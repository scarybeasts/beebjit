These discs are interesting in some way for emulator behavior testing.
Copyrights remain with their respective authors.


- Disc012-Nightworld.ssd
Not a difficult emulation case, but used to test replays.

- Disc103-OddJobD.ssd
Seems to require DFS-1.2 to correctly load.

- Disc106-AtticBugInSameGame.ssd
Reads ADC conversion (joystick position) and starts game if non-central.

- Disc116-DevilsIslandSTD.ssd
Complicated video timing setup with MODE7 switch halfway down the screen.

- EliteA-unofficial.ssd
Has bug where it relies on disc spindown invalidating drive ready status. If
the drive ready isn't invalidated, pressing f0 to start the game and launch
the ship will fail.

- Nubium 20181214 b.ssd
Needs a Master. Upon game start, triggers an interesting shadow memory bug
with an unusual combination of ACCCON bits. Should actually fail to start game
correctly on real hardware.

- PharaohsCurse.ssd
Requires crazy light pen simulation support before game will start. No actual
light pen required, it's an internal fakery between system VIA and CRTC.

- PLAY_DISC.ssd, SAVE_DISC.ssd
Disc for drives 0 / 1 for Dragonsoft Explorer.
Dragonsoft Explorer requires sideways RAM and has a custom disc loading
routine that issue unusual i8271 commands directly.
Also seems to do timing / video tricks.

- Repton2-alt.ssd
Has an issue (bug?) that leaves the Speech subsystem latched on.
