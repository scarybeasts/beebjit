These discs are interesting in some way for emulator display testing.
Behavior of the 6845 CRTC, SAA5050 Teletext chip and BBC Micro video ULA are
tested pretty extensively.

- LinearTTX.ssd
By VectorEyes.
Renders an animation in 2MHz bitmapped + linear addressing mode. Requires
emulation of the MA6 XOR documented here:

- mode1+7.ssd
Unearthed by !FOZ! and posted to Stardot here:
https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=23941
Does a split screen MODE1 / MODE7. Tests tons of corner cases such as 2MHz
teletext mode, non-interlaced teletext, accurate teletext scanline tracking,
and more.

- mode7-75.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/126
By Kieran Connell.
Messes with CRTC R9 in MODE 7.

- mode7-bug.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/141
By Kieran Connell.
Triggers interesting MODE 7 character states.

- Music2.ssd
From http://mdfs.net/Mirror/Image/JGH/Music2.ssd
The Doctor Who song playback displays MODE 8.

- raster-c.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
Excellent test case of Hitachi CRTC corner cases.

- rvi-working.ssd
By Rich Talbot-Watkins.
Uses the video ULA teletext on/off toggle to perform per-line display blanking
at 2MHz. Very sensitive to timing of when video ULA writes take effect.
(Note that the correct rendering does feature 2 pixels of nonsense at the
start of every scanline.)

- teletest_v1.ssd
Various teletext tests.
Includes the famous Teletext engineering test page.
And a test by me that tests additional things.

- upside-doom.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
CRTC test case that uses a multiple frames per horizontal line, and illustrates
the CRTC quirk of "no display on last horizontal character".

- upside-doom-no-skew.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
As above but uses a strange skew trick to avoid the problem of "no display on
last horizontal character".
