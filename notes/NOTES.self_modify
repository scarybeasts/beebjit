This is an interesting challenge for the optimizer and dynamic operand detector
because the modified LDA's are typically eliminated in the x64 backend.

10) Exile
- Has it all. See disassembly at:
http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/exile-disassembly.txt
- LDA ABY at $1022.
- Less common, has LDA ZPG, e.g. in the sprite routine at $102B.
- STY ABS at $1051.
- Self-modify writes either an INX or DEX, e.g. target at $105C.
- A more complicated rearrangement of instructions at $1066.
- Lots of mode IMM, e.g. ADC IMM at $107C, LDX IMM at $248F. CMP IMM popular.
