Knowing the keyboard is very important to using the BBC, and also to knowing
how to use some important features of beebjit.

General notes on modern keyboards
=================================

- To press a function key, such as F1, you typically need to press Fn + F1.

Mac-style keyboards
===================

This guide is currently written with a PC-style keyboard in mind. A Mac-style
keyboard has significant differences:
- What is called "Backspace" on PC-style is "delete" on Mac-style. A Mac-style
may not have a "Delete", so the nice shortcut below for BBC Break may not be
available if you're on a Mac.
- Keys mentioned below such as "PgUp", "Home", etc. may not directly exist on
a Mac.
- !! Left shift is mapped to BBC Caps Lock. This is because the Mac caps lock
key is handled poorly in macOS itself.
- !! Right shift is mapped BBC Shift.
- The PC-style Alt key is the option key on Mac-style. When reading a key
combination such as Alt-F below, use option-F on a Mac.


BBC keys
========

- BBC Break is mapped to both F12 and Delete (PC-style, not Mac-style)
  On a PC-style, you may prefer to use Delete, to avoid Fn+F12 gymnastics
- BBC F0 is mapped to F10
- BBC @ is mapped to `
- BBC Copy is mapped to End
- BBC underscore / pound is mapped to PgUp
- BBC Shift Lock is mapped to "windows key"
