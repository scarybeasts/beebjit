Bugs and improvements
=====================

IMPORTANT
=========
Ideally, important items get fixed before the next release.
The includes: bugs and deficiencies that are egregious. Feature requests that
are currently prioritized.


JIT improvements
================

- ARM64 partial zero page caching in host registers (turbocharge or flop?)
- Investigate mode REL for dynamic operand (see Castle Quest)
- Re-add mode IDX address optimization (Galaforce?)
- x64 and ARM64: page crossing check is ripe for optimization (Galaforce sprite
loop)
- BCD support in JIT. It gives accurate results but slowly because it uses the
interpreter. No evidence yet of intense BCD usage in anything that needs to go
fast.
- JIT block timing code improvements. Currently, there's a non-trivial
instruction sequence after every conditional branch in a JIT block. This
sequence can be improved a lot. For example, there only needs to be a branch
at the start of the block. Also, the timing subtractions do not need to be
dependent on one another.
- Replace div with mul?


Fix later
=========
Bugs and issues not serious enough to warrant fixing before the next release.

- Update BCD for 65c12.
- "back in time" support in the debugger via fast replay.
- Tape loading noises.
- Disc loading noises.


Peformance tuning
=================
Software running slower than it might for various reasons. Fun to knock these
improvements out one by one on a rainy day.
These speeds are for JIT mode. In some cases here, interp mode is faster
because of some very severe JIT interaction.

(all: -mode jit -opt sound:off)
(5th gen i5, v0.9.4 or so)
- Elite.ssd. Slams hardware registers in a tight loop reading keyboard.
- Tarzan.ssd. Very slow (120MHz). interp is faster!! Looks to be a tight
wait-for-vsync loop at $24D9 causing a lot of thrash. Surely this is common.
- Tricky's Frogger. 150Mhz only. 126k CRTC/s due to CRTC register abuse.
- Crazee Rider (swram version). 27MHz, terrible! Taking a lot of recompiles
and faults.
- Uridium. 200MHz. 1 million+ faults a second?
(11th gen i7, v0.9.5+)
- Elite.ssd. Slams hardware registers. 3.3GHz.
- Tarzan.ssd. Tight vsync wait loop. 620MHz. 32.6M reg hits/s!
- Uridium.ssd. 725MHz. 830k CRTC/s.
- Firetrack.ssd. Recompiles(!), CRTC abuse. 500MHz. 400k CRTC/s.


Ideas
=====

Ideas: ideas sufficiently interesting that they are likely to be investigated
and implemented.

- Record and playback. Since the "accurate" mode has deterministic execution
behavior, we can "record" a machine session by just logging and playing back
the sources of non-determinism -- i.e. key presses and releases.
A recording can be exited at any time, fast forwarded, etc. One great use
would be to record run-throughs of tricky games (i.e. Exile), which can be
"taken over" at any point.
[half done]

- Terminal (and headless terminal) modes. Rewires serial I/O to stdio.
[half done]

- Rewind.
Possibly linked to record and playback above, rewind would go back in time a
little bit when a key is hit.


Backburner
==========

Backburner: ideas or bugs that aren't particularly important to fix.

- Save state / load state.
- Mouse support.
- Joystick support.
- NULA support.
