Let's get quickly started!
Once you have read this, you may also wish to read EXAMPLES.
Do also considering reading KEYS for a list of important keys.

1) Starting up with no disc or tape media.
You can just run the executable with no command line arguments, i.e.
./beebjit
or
beebjit.exe

A BBC Micro should fire up. Even with no media loaded, it's still reasonably
capable because it boots up to a command prompt with a full BASIC language at
your disposal. The most typical way of demonstrating your BASIC prowess would
be to type in these three lines, pressing Enter at the end of each:

10 PRINT "HELLO OMG"
20 GOTO 10
RUN


2) Booting up a disc image.
You can run the executable with a single command line argument to put a disc
image in drive 0, which is the default drive:
./beebjit -0 test/games/Disc108-FroggerRSCB.ssd

To boot from the disc, the BBC had a special keyboard combination. You hold down
Shift and then press and release Break while the Shift key remains pressed.
Break is mapped to the F12 key on a modern keyboard, which requires Fn + F12 to
be pressed on many systems. So the full gymnastics would be: hold down Shift and
Fn simultaneously and while holding them down, tap and release F12.
Note that you'll need to use the right shift on Apple Macs -- see KEYS.
