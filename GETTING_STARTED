Let's get quickly started!
Once you have read this, you may also wish to read EXAMPLES.

1) Starting up with no disc or tape media.
You can just run the executable with no command line arguments, i.e.
./beebjit
or
beebjit.exe

A BBC Micro should fire up. Even with no media loaded, it's still reasonably
capable because it boots up to a command prompt with a full BASIC language at
your disposal. The most typical way of demonstrating your BASIC prowess would
be to type in these three lines, pressing Enter at the end of each:

10 PRINT "HELLO OMG"
20 GOTO 10
RUN


2) Booting up a disc image.
You can run the executable with a single command line argument to put a disc
image in drive 0, which is the default drive:
./beebjit -0 test/games/Disc108-FroggerRSCB.ssd

To boot from the disc, the BBC had a special keyboard combination. You hold down
Shift and then press and release Break while the Shift key remains pressed.
Break is mapped to the F12 key on a modern keyboard, which requires Fn + F12 to
be pressed on many systems. So the full gymnastics would be: hold down Shift and
Fn simultaneously and while holding them down, tap and release F12.
